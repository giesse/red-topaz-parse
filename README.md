# A version of Topaz' `parse` function for Red

This is a simple direct port of Topaz' `parse` function to Red. It should perhaps be rewritten in Red/System (any takers?),
or, if we keep it as a mezz, it would make sense to rewrite it using Red's `parse` instead.

Docs and examples coming if there is interest. Otherwise it's just going to be something I play with from time to time.
